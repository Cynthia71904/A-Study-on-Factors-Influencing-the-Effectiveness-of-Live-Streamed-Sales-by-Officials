# Abstract

With the rise of e-commerce and live-streaming platforms, “official live-streaming for poverty alleviation” has become a new form of rural development in China. This study investigates the factors influencing the effectiveness of government officials’ live-streaming in promoting products from impoverished regions. Based on qualitative case analysis and quantitative experiments, the research identifies three key dimensions: officials’ personal attributes (such as gender and charisma), political factors (official rank), and situational factors (emotional involvement and visual design).

Empirical results show that officials’ rank and emotional involvement significantly enhance live-streaming performance, while gender interacts with product type—male officials are more effective with agricultural products, and female officials perform better with handicrafts. The findings provide theoretical and practical insights for optimizing live-streaming strategies, improving product sales, and fostering sustainable economic growth in poverty-stricken areas.
